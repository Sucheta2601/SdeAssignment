This are the screenshots of my files and the errors in my task. In readme file of this main repository.
And this is the code 

DAILY LEAD PROCESSOR FILE 
global class DailyLeadProcessor implements Schedulable {
    
    global void execute(SchedulableContext ctx) {
        List<Lead> leadsToUpdate = [SELECT Id, LeadSource FROM Lead WHERE LeadSource = '' LIMIT 200];
        for (Lead lead : leadsToUpdate) {
            lead.LeadSource = 'Webinar';
        }
        update leadsToUpdate;
    }
}



testDailyleadprocessor file 
@isTest
static void testDailyLeadProcessor() {
    DailyLeadProcessor dlp = new DailyLeadProcessor();
    // Insert 200 test Lead records
    List<Lead> testLeads = new List<Lead>();
    for (Integer i = 0; i < 200; i++) {
        testLeads.add(new Lead(
            FirstName = 'Test',
            LastName = 'Lead ' + i,
            Company = 'Test Company',
            Status = 'New'
        ));
    }
    insert testLeads;

    // Schedule the DailyLeadProcessor class to run
    Test.startTest();
    String jobId = System.schedule('Test Job', '0 0 0 * * ?',  dlp);
    Test.stopTest();

    // Verify that all Lead records were updated correctly
    List<Lead> updatedLeads = [SELECT Id, LeadSource FROM Lead WHERE LeadSource = 'Dreamforce'];
    System.assertEquals(200, updatedLeads.size(), 'All test Lead records should have been updated');
}
