Explanation-
It takes in the old task queue, the current index, and the new task queue and returns the index of the Current Index Memberin the new task queue. 
If the Current Index Member is not present in the new task queue,then it finds the index of the next available member to the Current Index Member in the new task queue. 
If no such member is found, it returns -1.
